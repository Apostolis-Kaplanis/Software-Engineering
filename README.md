# Software-Engineering

The **objective** of this project is to develop a simple Latex editor for inexperienced Latex users. 
The **goal** of the editor is to facilitate the usage of Latex commands for the preparation of Latex documents. 
One of the prominent **features** that distinguishes the LatexEditor from other similar applications is its multi-strategy version tracking functionalities that enable undo and redo actions.

From architectural point of view, was used *Model-View-Controller(MVC)*. It was used *swing* library for the building of GUI.

Moreover this project is developed with some of the most common **design patterns**:
 * Prototype pattern
 * Strategy pattern
 * *Parameterized* Factory pattern
 * Command pattern
 
 Finally as every software engineering project, it is validated via **Acceptance Tests** that correspond to the different *user stories* that was asked. 
 
***Notes:***
Included files (also *UML class diagrams* files) were generated via *Eclipse IDE*'s workspace.
